# Welcome to Eru Labs

> A collective of hackers, researchers, artists, and dreamers building AI that serves humanity

We're not just another AI lab. Born from hacker culture and IRC communities, we believe in radical transparency, collaborative innovation, and the fundamental right to free and open information. While others abandoned their principles for profit, we hold fast to a simple truth: technology should empower everyone, not just the few.

## Who We're Looking For

We welcome anyone who shares our vision of human-centric AI and radical openness. Whether you're a:

- **Hackers & Researchers** - Exploring multi-agent systems, emergent behaviors, and AI social dynamics
- **SREs & Software Engineers** - Building production-scale systems that bridge theory and practice  
- **Tinkerers & DIYers** - Taking things apart, figuring out how they work, making them better
- **Artists** - Both audio and visual creators who understand technology as a medium for expression
- **Philosophers** - Thinking deeply about ethics, human agency, and the future we're building
- **Nerds** - Obsessed with understanding how things work and making them work better

If you believe in the hacker ethos that "information wants to be free" and that access to knowledge should be unlimited and total, you belong here.

## Our Values

- **Radical Openness** - Every line of code, every research paper, every breakthrough
- **Hacker Ethics** - Access to computers and knowledge should be unlimited and total
- **Internet Freedom** - Fighting surveillance capitalism and corporate capture of digital spaces
- **Human-Centric AI** - Technology that augments human intelligence rather than replacing it
- **Collaborative Spirit** - Like IRC channels where ideas flow freely across boundaries
- **Production Reality** - Research that's battle-tested in real systems
